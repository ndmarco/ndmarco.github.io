I am currently a PhD student in the department of [Biostatistcs](https://www.biostat.ucla.edu/) at UCLA, under the supervision of [Donatello Telesca](https://donatello-telesca.com/). My primary research focuses on Bayesian methods for functional data analysis and its applications to the field of neuroscience. In addition to my main research, I provide statistical support to a research group, led by [Joanne Weidhaas](https://www.uclahealth.org/radonc/joanne-weidhaas), in the department of [Radiation Oncology](https://www.uclahealth.org/radonc/). The main reseach objective of the group is to use genetic markers to predict how well patients would respond to various types of cancer treatments. I also cohost a monthly podcast called [Two Nearest Neighbors](https://anchor.fm/twonearestneighbors) with [Xinkai Zhou](https://xinkai-zhou.github.io/), where we talk with leading researchers about various topics in statistics, machine learning, and big data.
