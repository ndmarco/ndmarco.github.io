I am currently a Postdoctoral Associate in the department of [Statistical Science](https://stat.duke.edu/) at Duke University, under the supervision of [Surya Tokdar](https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~st118/) and [Jennifer Groh](https://people.duke.edu/~jmgroh/). Prior to joining Duke, I recieved my PhD in [Biostatistics](https://www.biostat.ucla.edu/) from UCLA under the supervision of [Donatello Telesca](https://donatello-telesca.com/). 

My research focuses on developing scalable Bayesian models with applications to neuroscience. Within this context, my primary research consists of developing Bayesian point process models for spike-train data, as well as developing Bayesian functional models with applications to neuroimaging (EEG).
