title: "Application of a genetic signature of late GU toxicity in SCIMITAR, a Post-op SBRT trial"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2023-SCIMITAR
excerpt: 'Predictors of genitourinary toxicity after post-prostatectomy radiotherapy remain elusive. A previously defined germline DNA signature (PROSTOX) has shown predictive ability for late grade â‰¥ 2 GU toxicity after intact prostate stereotactic body radiotherapy. We explore whether PROSTOX would predict toxicity among patients receiving post-prostatectomy SBRT on a phase II clinical trial.'
