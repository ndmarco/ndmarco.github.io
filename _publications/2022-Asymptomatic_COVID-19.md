title: "Viral burden and clearance in asymptomatic COVID-19 Patients"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/Asym_C19
excerpt: 'We found important differences and similarities between asymptomatic and symptomatic COVID-19-positive patients, the most meaningful being a similar level of virus as measured by PCR, but a shorter duration of PCR positivity for asymptomatic patients. These findings suggest that asymptomatic patients may have more efficient clearance of virus, which may be relevant for management and screening.'
